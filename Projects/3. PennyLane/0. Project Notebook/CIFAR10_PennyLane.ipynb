        "One can extend the same idea also to the context of quantum variational circuits. A possible approach is given by the following procedure which is very similar to the one used in Ref. [1]. The scheme is also represented in the figure at the top of this tutorial.\n",

        "1. A small region of the input image, in our example a 2Ã—2 square, is embedded into a quantum circuit. In this demo, this is achieved with parametrized rotations applied to the qubits initialized in the ground state.\n",
        "2. A quantum computation, associated to a unitary U, is performed on the system. The unitary could be generated by a variational quantum circuit or, more simply, by a random circuit as proposed in Ref. [1].\n",
        "3. The quantum system is finally measured, obtaining a list of classical expectation values. The measurement results could also be classically post-processed as proposed in Ref. [1] but, for simplicity, in this demo we directly use the raw expectation values.\n",
        "4. Analogously to a classical convolution layer, each expectation value is mapped to a different channel of a single output pixel.\n",
        "5. Iterating the same procedure over different regions, one can scan the full input image, producing an output object which will be structured as a multi-channel image.\n",
        "6. The quantum convolution can be followed by further quantum layers or by classical layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference with respect to a classical convolution is that a quantum circuit can generate highly complex kernels whose computation could be, at least in principle, classically intractable."
