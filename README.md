**Project: QML for image processing**

**Mentor:** Viratkumar Kothari

**Description:** I am heading digital archives of one of the reputed archives on Mahatma Gandhi where I have quite a huge number of digital archival images. I want to process them using computer vision using machine learning  to identify people in the images. I can do this using normal machine learning but I feel I should use Quantum Computing so that to make and process them for long future.
